A System Infrastructure Engineer's notes.

# What is this site?
Hi, welcome. This website is a collection of notes of mine, A single source of truth of my knowledge, a more-structured blog, if you will. I created this site to document things I encountered, be they problems, concepts, or scattered information across the web.

All this is in hopes that when I reference things I encountered, I can just come back to this site and solve the issue instead of wasting another day or two fumbling with the same problems again. As such, this site is structured and written with the convenience of future me. Sometimes the information might be very detailed; other times, it might have many pre-requisite details to understand.

However, as someone from the programming sphere once said, "Your mind next week is as good as a stranger's mind, so document it the way a stranger would understand." The information on this site should be a starting point of reference, where you can quickly learn the required 20% to start exploring the 80% yourself. It would be my honor if someone else benefitted from the information written on this site, as I have helped save time that would probably be wasted on bug-hunting.

# Who are you?
My name is Gregorius Bryan; I go by Bryan, Greg, or Selubi on the internet. I am a System Infrastructure Engineer at [Rakuten](https://global.rakuten.com/corp/). I am in a unique environment where I can learn various technology fields. At this job, there's a very high chance that the next project I do requires an entirely different skillset/stack from the previous one. As such, while it provides an excellent learning opportunity, I must adequately document it to avoid forgetting it by the next project.

# Why should I trust you?
You shouldn't. I am a single person on the internet, unless you're the future me, treat it like so. As with everything on the internet, always cross-check everything you read on this site. Think of it like asking Chat GPT a question. The answers from Chat GPT provide a good starting point for knowledge, but it sometimes spits out a wrong/outdated answer. Even if the information is correct, you must almost always tweak it to your use case.

# Why is this site also available in Japanese?
Because I am based in Japan, for accessibility of information within Japan and my practice so I don't forget Japanese, I also made the site accessible in Japanese. I don't want to spend my whole weekend translating; it's a very intensive task. Instead, I will throw the English text I wrote and throw it to [DeepL Translate](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) and edit it. How intensive the edit is will depend on the post, but I will properly check relevant links and terms.

"Are your Japanese better than a machine translator?" you might ask, and that's a fair point. I have the [JLPT N1](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/) certification, but a certification is just a certification. If you understand Japanese, read the Japanese posts here, and you should be able to gauge how well/bad my Japanese is.

For reference, here is this post translated as is straight from DeepL. You can compare it with the Japanese version of this post.
