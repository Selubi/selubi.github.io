### Service Resiliency: **Region**

This note is based on [Adrian Cantrill's AWS Course](https://learn.cantrill.io/)

## What is it?

AWS S3 is a flat key-value data storage service.
We can store data in a container called **Buckets**.

When we store data value in buckets, we can assign a key to the value, making the data is accessible if we have the bucket name and key for it.

This key-value pair is called an **Object**.

Objects are stored flat inside a bucket (i.e. there is no nesting directory structure).
We can prepend directory-like prefix to a key giving it a filesystem-like structure to navigate through, however always remember that the data is stored flat inside a bucket.

## Characteristic

- Bucket names are globally unique.
- 100 Soft limit, 1000 Hard limit / AWS Account
- Bucket names consist of 3 - 63 characters with no underscores
- Bucket names start with a lowercase letter or a number
- Bucket names cannot be formatted like an IP
- Object can range in size from 0 byte to 5TB, and one bucket can hold unlimited amount of objects.
